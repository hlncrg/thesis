\chapter{Numerical Models of Pulsar Magnetosphere}
\label{chapter:numericalModels}

This chapter focuses on numerically derived 
pulsar models.  We concentrate on the geometrically based 
modeling of pulsar magnetic field lines.  From this 
formulation, we derive the $\gamma$-ray light curves
and the radio polarization position angle sweeps.  
We also discuss
the X-ray pulsar wind tori model which is often used
in conjunction with the $\gamma$-ray and radio modeling.
