Stokes parameter curves (black is total intensity, red is linear polarized intensity, and
blue is circularly polarized intensity) and Gaussian decomposition
of the linear intensity components (dotted curve is all linear and the thick green
curve gives the rapid sweep central component fit here). Bottom: position angle
data (blue: central components, yellow: other position angle values, green: P1 tail with
an orthogonal mode jump). The smooth curves give the best fit model for the two
poles while the red circles denote the boundaries of the open zone at the
emission altitude. Arrows denote the phase of the closest approach of the
magnetic axes to the Earth line-of-sight.

The paper \citep{guillemot2013fermi} reports the detection of 
PSR J0737$-$3039A, the first detection of
a mildly recycled pulsar by the {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope.  
Such a pulsar is only mildly spun up by its companion.
The pulsar PSR J0737$-$3039A
is in a 2.4 hour orbit with another pulsar
\citep{burgay2003increased,lyne2004double}.
Such a detection is exciting
because it fills in an underpopulated
region of the $P$-$\dot{P}$ picture
\citep{psrcat}.

Further,  understanding the pulsars formation has been 
of interest.
The viewing angle is a measure of the misalignment
between the spin axis and orbital angular momentum
since the inclination of the binary system is 
known.  This measurement in turn is given as $\zeta$
near $90^\circ$ (as discussed below) indicating 
that the misalignment angle is small.
This has important implications on the formation
theory of the system 
\citep{breton2008relativistic,ferdman2013double,podsiadlowski2005double}.

The 1.4 GHz data from Parkes radio telescope was
used in the analysis of 
PSR J0737$-$3039A.
We used orthogonal mode jumps and interstellar
scattering as well as multiple and finite altitude.
We fit only the central components of the two peaks. 
We believed that the trailing edges of
the emission was dominated by plasma effects
and that the present model would not adequately 
capture the field line structure from 
this much higher emission.  Thus we 
favored modeling only the central part
of the polarization of the two radio peaks.
In particular, the flattened components of 
the polarization can not be modeled using
typical magnetic field lines and single altitudes.  
 
Figure~\ref{fig:polarfit} labels the  
Gaussian components used for the intensity 
in the upper panel (green thick line) and the polarization in
the lower panel (blue data points).  
The unmodeled data points are in yellow on
the Figure~\ref{fig:polarfit}.
Trailing edges of $P1$ in linear intensity
are separated from the central component
by linear intensity of zero which suggests
a orthogonal mode jump (for a more in depth 
discussion of this phenomena see Section \ref{sec:MAISOM}). 
The green data points show the
polarization offset by 90$^\circ$.

The black and green solid lines on the lower
panel of Figure~\ref{fig:polarfit} are the best fit model
to the blue polarization data points.
The altitudes for the two components are
different at $0.01R_{\rm{LC}}$ for $P1$ and 
$0.11R_{\rm{LC}}$ for $P2$.  At these altitudes,
The red circles indicate the open zone 
phase expected.  Interestingly, the polarization
not modeled falls outside of this phase, indicating
that the polarization is from higher altitude emission
or from emission within the formal closed zone and hinting
at reasons for its unusual structure.  Indeed, our model is
then one where the central components are from the center
of a hollow cone of emission where the altitude is relatively low
and the wings are from the higher altitudes of the cone.
Full fit parameters and errors are given in Table \ref{tab:polarfitpars}.
The fit map of $\chi^2$ is given in Figure~\ref{fig:polarchisq}.

The results of the polarization fitting were compared to 
$\gamma$-ray light curve modeling results.  Namely,
the polarization fitting produced a phase of closest approach for 
the surface dipole axis.  Both outer gap and two-pole caustic
models produced acceptable light curves in the region
of best fit in the radio polarization as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:lcmodeling2}.  But the 
model phase zero ($\phi=0$) of the radio and $\gamma$-ray is offset by
$0.1$.  One possible explanation is the lack of 
plasma effects in the modeling.  
For instance, \cite{kalapotharakos2012gamma}
found that including finite conductivity in
magnetohydrodynamics simulations will cause such
a lag compared to vacuum models.

In addition to polarization modeling,
simultaneous fits in radio and $\gamma$-ray
to the light curves
was also performed resulting in
similar geometric angle constrains.
