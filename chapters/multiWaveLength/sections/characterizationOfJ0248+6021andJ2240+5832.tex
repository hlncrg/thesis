The red points show the data used in the RVM fit. The black points failed the selection cuts
described in the text. Top two frames are data for PSR J2240$+$5832 at 1.4 GHz. The RVM curve shown corresponds to $\alpha = 108^\circ$ and $\zeta = 123^\circ$. Bottom two frames are data for PSR J0248+6021

Contours are at $\delta(\chi^2/\text{Degree of Freedom}) = 0.25$ and $0.5$ above the minimum $\chi^2/\text{Degree of Freedom}$ of 1.6
for PSR J0248$+$6021 and $\delta(\chi^2/\text{Degree of Freedom}) = 0.4$ and $0.8$ above the minimum $\chi^2/\text{Degree of Freedom}$ of 5.1
for PSR J2240$+$5832.
The color backgrounds are $\chi_3$ maps of the fit to the observed $>100$\,MeV
pulse profile for the outer gap model (left),
the two-pole caustic model (middle), and the separatrix layer model (right), 
at different values of the magnetic inclination,
$\alpha$, and the minimum angle to the line-of-sight, $\zeta$ \citep{romani2010constraining}.
Each panel has the same color scale, where dark colors represent better fits. The
preferred models lie along the green RVM-selected band.

PSR J0248$+$6021 ($P=217$ ms) and PSR J2240$+$5832 ($P=140$ms) are young pulsars first discovered in the radio
\citep{foster1997fast,ray1999j0248+}.  The polarization sweep for both pulsars is relatively smooth
such that likely only a single-altitude component contributes to the emission.

For these two pulsars, we applied both the RVM and $\gamma$-ray light curve models
to the available data.
Figure~\ref{phasos} shows the light curves at various wavelengths
as well as the polarization data.
Modeling results indicate that the $\gamma$-ray emission from PSR J0248$+$6021
is from a merged double $\gamma$-ray peak while the emission from 
PSR J2240$+$5832 is from a narrow caustic.
The paper discusses various measurements of the
pulsars PSR J0248$+$6021 and PSR J2240$+$5832 such as
flux density, proper motion, dispersion measure, kick velocity, and rotation
measure. 

We applied the RVM to the polarization data of 
PSR J0248$+$6021 (2.1 GHz) and PSR J2240$+$5832 (1.4 GHz).  
We cut on polarization with error bars greater than
 $\pm 2^\circ$.
The polarization position angle sweeps are flattened
due to scattering.  Data at 1.4 GHz was avaliable for PSR J0248$+$6021
but appeared distorted by scatter so only the 2.1 GHz data was used.
Red error bars on Figure~\ref{PolarZoom} show points
used in the fitting procedure.  

For PSR J0248$+$6021, the best fits give geometric angles $\beta\sim5^\circ$ 
(where $\beta=\zeta-\alpha$) and $\alpha$ between $25^\circ$ and $110^\circ$.
The best $\chi^2$ is 86.6 with reduced $\chi_{\rm{min}}^2=1.6$.
For PSR J2240$+$5832, the best fits give geometric angles $\beta\sim16^\circ$ and $\alpha$ between $75^\circ$ and $130^\circ$
although plausible solutions extended to $\alpha$ between $10^\circ$ and $150^\circ$.
The best $\chi^2$ is 86.6 with reduced $\chi_{\rm{min}}^2=1.6$.
Figure~\ref{PolarZoom} additionally shows reasonable model polarization sweeps
overlaid on data points.

On Figure~\ref{OGTPC}, green contours trace the best fit RVM in the $\alpha$-$\zeta$ plane.
The colored maps show best fit outer gap model, two-pole caustic model, 
and separatrix layer model \citep{bai2010modeling} to the $\gamma$-ray data.
The weighting used is the $\chi_3$ of \cite{romani2010constraining}.
For PSR J0248$+$6021, the best fit overlap between outer gap and RVM
model is $\alpha=46^\circ$ and $\zeta=52^\circ$.
For PSR J2240$+$5832, the best fit overlap between outer gap and RVM
models is $\alpha=101^\circ$ and $\zeta=117^\circ$.
Overall, the outer gap model seemed to be more consistent
with the polarization model results
than the other $\gamma$-ray models.
