\section{pulsars}

Pulsars are objects of extremes.

The fastest neutron star is PSR J1748-2446ad
 

\subsection{The origin of pulsars and Supernova remnants}

A star will eventually collapse under its own gravity once it has exhausted its energy source.  
If the star is massive enough, such a transition will come about violently in a 
supernova explosion where most of the mass is expelled in a shell around the position
star once was. This glowing mass known as a supernova remnent.  The remander of the 
star collapses further either into a blackhole or a neutron star depending on the 
original mass of the star.  Since most of the angular momentum is conserved, the
much smaller, denser neutron star has a very small rotational period.


Pulsars originate from supernova explosions 
Supernova remnants exist for 100 to 1000 years.

Conservation of angular momentum and magnetic flux:

$ 
M R^2_0 \Omega_0=M R^2 \Omega
P \sim (R/R_0) P_0 \sim 
B \sim (R/R_0) B_0 \sim 10^10-10^12 Gauss
R^2_0 B_0 = R^2 B
$


2) What is the fastest spinning pulsar?

The rotational period of pulsars range from a couple of milliseconds to 
several seconds.  For instance, J$1748-2446$ab has a period of $1.395$ms \cite{hessels2006radio}.

3) Highest magnetic field

The magnetic fields of pulsars are around $10^10$ to $10^12$ Gauss.

Magnetars, neutron stars with the extreme magnetic field, are said to have
magnetic fields of up to $10^15$ Gauss.  (The magnetic field of the Earth is 
around $\sim .4$ Gauss and the magnetic field of the sun is around $\sim 1$ Gauss, for reference.) 

4) most massive

One of the most massive pulsars is J$1311-3430$ which is said to have a mass
of $2.15$ to $2.7M_{\odot}$ (solar mass) from spectroscopic measurements \cite{romani2012psr}.

5) radius

The radius of a neutron star is around $10$km.  (The circumference is around the distance from
San Fransisco to San Jose.)

6) When was polarization first observed?

William Hilter and John Hall first observed polarization of starlight in 1949 \cite{hiltner1949polarization,hall1949observations }.  
Polarization was soon linked to magnetic field lines of the galaxy by Leverrett Davis, Jr and Jesse Greenstein \cite{davis1951polarization}

7) First prediction of neutron stars

Neutron stars were first predicted as a result of 
supernoveas by \cite{baade1934super}.  

8) First observation of pulsars

Although the first supernovea was observed thousands of years ago,
the first pulsations (in radio) from a pulsars were not observed until 
relativily recently in 1967 to 1968.

9) First explanation of pulsars

The first correct and complete explination of pulsars and their
connection to neutrons followed rapidly by Gold and Pacini
(\cite{pacini1967energy, gold1968rotating, pacini1968rotating}).

10) How many pulsars are there vs. neutron stars?

The number of galactic neutron stars is $\sim10^9$ although 
how many are actually visible from earth depends on a number of caveats \cite{colpi1998elusiveness}.
The number of radio-detected pulsars is in the low thousands and the number of energetic $\gamma$-ray
detected pulsars is in the low hundreds.

Goldreich-Julian model
Force free model:
$F=E+\Omega \times r / c \times B = 0 $
Then density$1/(4 \pi) \div E = - \Omega \dot B / (2 \pi c)$
The charge rearranges due to this uncanceled rotation-induced EMF.

The magnetic field is given by 
$\vec{B}=-( \vec{m(t_r)} +r\dot{\vec{m(t_r)}} + r^2\ddot{\vec{m(t_r)}}  )/r^3 + \^{r} \left\{\^{r} \cdot (\vec{m(t_r)} +r\dot{3\vec{m(t_r)}} + 3r^2\ddot{\vec{m(t_r)}})/r^3  \right\} $


$\vec{m(t_r)}=m(\sin{(\alpha)} \cos{(t_r \omega)} \^{x}+ \sin{(\alpha)}) \sin{(t_r \omega)} \^{y} \cos{(\alpha)} \^{z}$
